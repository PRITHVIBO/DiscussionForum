# 3. SYSTEM ANALYSIS

## 3.1 Feasibility Study

The project is technically feasible due to availability of required technologies, skilled development team, access to development tools and environments, and established web development practices.

Development costs are reasonable with open-source tools reducing licensing expenses, minimal hosting costs, and manageable long-term maintenance costs.

The user-friendly interface reduces training needs, intuitive navigation minimizes learning curve, administrative tools are straightforward, and the system can be operated with minimal technical expertise.

The project timeline is realistic with well-defined development phases, achievable testing and deployment schedules, and appropriate resource allocation.

## 3.2 Requirements Analysis

Primary stakeholders include end users (community members who participate in discussions), administrators (system managers who oversee operations), and moderators (users responsible for content management). Secondary stakeholders include system developers (technical team maintaining the platform) and content contributors (active users who create valuable content).

Requirements were gathered through interviews with potential users, analysis of existing forum systems, review of user feedback from similar platforms, and technical requirement specifications.

## 3.3 Functional Requirements

**User Management:**
Users can create accounts with email verification, utilize secure login/logout functionality, update their profiles and preferences, and manage passwords with reset and change capabilities.

**Discussion Management:**
Users can create new discussion topics, reply to topics and other replies, categorize and organize threads, and edit their own posts.

**Search and Navigation:**
The system provides full-text search across topics and posts, filtering options by category, date, user, efficient pagination through large content sets, and bookmarking for favorite topics.

**Administrative Functions:**
Administrators can manage user accounts, moderate inappropriate content, create and manage discussion categories, and configure system-wide settings.

## 3.4 Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:** Page load time should be less than 3 seconds, the system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users, database queries should complete within 1 second, and search results should be returned within 2 seconds.

**Security:** User passwords must be encrypted, session management must be secure, input validation must prevent SQL injection, XSS protection must be implemented, and CSRF protection must be in place.

**Usability:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, the system should be accessible to users with disabilities, help documentation should be available, and error messages should be clear and helpful.

**Reliability:** System uptime should be 99.5%, data backup should occur daily, error recovery mechanisms should be in place, and the system should handle peak loads gracefully.

---

# 4. SYSTEM DESIGN

## 4.1 Architecture Design

The system follows a three-tier architecture with a presentation layer (user interface components, client-side validation, responsive design elements), application layer (business logic implementation, API endpoints, data processing), and data layer (database management, data access objects, query optimization).

The system implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern where the Model handles data structures and business logic, database interactions, and data validation rules; the View manages user interface templates, presentation logic, and client-side components; and the Controller handles request handling, response generation, and business logic coordination.

## 4.2 Database Design

The database consists of the following main tables:

**Users Table:** user_id (Primary Key), username, email, password_hash, registration_date, last_login, user_role, profile_picture, bio

**Topics Table:** topic_id (Primary Key), title, description, created_by (Foreign Key), created_date, category_id (Foreign Key), view_count, reply_count, is_sticky, is_locked

**Posts Table:** post_id (Primary Key), topic_id (Foreign Key), user_id (Foreign Key), content, created_date, updated_date, parent_post_id (Foreign Key)

**Categories Table:** category_id (Primary Key), name, description, created_by (Foreign Key), created_date

**Database Relationships:** Users can create multiple topics (One-to-Many), topics belong to categories (Many-to-One), topics contain multiple posts (One-to-Many), and posts can have nested replies (Self-referencing).

## 4.3 Data Flow Diagrams

The context diagram shows the system boundary and external entities including users (Members, Moderators, Administrators), email service, and file storage system. Data flows include user requests and responses, email notifications, and file uploads and downloads.

The Level 1 DFD shows major functional processes: User Authentication Process, Topic Management Process, Discussion Management Process, Search and Navigation Process, and Administrative Process.

## 4.4 Use Case Diagrams

**Primary Actors:** Guest User, Registered User, Moderator, Administrator

**Guest User Use Cases:** Browse topics, search content, register account

**Registered User Use Cases:** Login/logout, create topics, post replies, edit profile, bookmark topics

**Moderator Use Cases:** Moderate content, manage categories, handle user reports

**Administrator Use Cases:** User management, system configuration, backup and restore

## 4.5 ER Diagrams

The Entity-Relationship model represents the relationships between entities:

**Entities and Attributes:**
- User (user_id, username, email, password, role)
- Topic (topic_id, title, description, created_date)
- Post (post_id, content, created_date, updated_date)
- Category (category_id, name, description)

**Relationships:**
- User creates Topic (1:N)
- Topic belongs to Category (N:1)
- Topic contains Post (1:N)
- Post has replies (1:N, self-referencing)

## 4.6 Module Design

**User Management Module Components:** Registration controller, authentication service, profile management, session management

**Discussion Module Components:** Topic controller, post controller, category management, search service

**Administrative Module Components:** User administration, content moderation, system settings, analytics dashboard

## 4.7 Flow Charts

The system utilizes several flow charts to represent the logical flow of processes and operations:

### 4.7.1 User Registration Flow
The registration process follows a sequential flow:
1. User accesses registration page
2. User fills in registration form (username, email, password)
3. System validates input data
4. System checks for duplicate username/email
5. If valid, create user account and store in database
6. Send verification email to user
7. User verifies email and account is activated

### 4.7.2 User Authentication Flow
The login process includes:
1. User enters credentials (email and password)
2. System validates input format
3. System checks credentials against database
4. If valid, create session and redirect to dashboard
5. If invalid, display error message and allow retry

### 4.7.3 Topic Creation Flow
The process for creating a new discussion topic:
1. Authenticated user clicks "New Topic"
2. User selects category and enters title and description
3. System validates input data
4. System stores topic in database
5. System updates category statistics
6. Redirect user to newly created topic page

### 4.7.4 Discussion Reply Flow
The reply process follows:
1. User views a topic/discussion
2. User clicks "Reply" button
3. User enters reply content
4. System validates input
5. System stores reply in database
6. System updates topic reply count
7. Display updated discussion with new reply

### 4.7.5 Administrative Moderation Flow
The content moderation process:
1. Admin/Moderator reviews reported content
2. Admin evaluates content against guidelines
3. Admin decides action (approve, edit, delete, warn user)
4. System executes selected action
5. System logs moderation activity
6. Notify relevant users of action taken
