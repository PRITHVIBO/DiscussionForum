# DISCUSSION FORUM SYSTEM - PROJECT REPORT

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Problem Identification
Traditional discussion forums face several challenges:
- Lack of modern user interfaces
- Limited scalability
- Poor mobile responsiveness
- Inadequate search functionality
- Security vulnerabilities
- High maintenance costs

The Discussion Forum System addresses these issues by providing a modern, intuitive UI, scalable architecture, mobile-responsive design, advanced search, robust security, and cost‑effective maintenance.

## 1.2 Project Scope
### In Scope
- User registration and authentication
- Topic and discussion management
- User profile management
- Search and filtering functionality
- Administrative dashboard and basic moderation tools
- Responsive web design
- Database integration

### Out of Scope
- Advanced AI-powered recommendations
- Video/audio content sharing
- Real-time chat functionality
- Third-party integrations
- Mobile application development
- Advanced analytics and reporting

## 1.3 Intended Users
- End users: community members who create topics and participate in discussions
- Moderators: users who review reports and moderate content
- Administrators: manage users, categories, settings, and system configuration

## 1.4 Tools and Technologies to be used
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery
- Backend: PHP
- Database: MySQL
- Web server: Apache
- Dev tools: Git, VS Code, XAMPP/WAMP, phpMyAdmin
- Architecture: MVC pattern, RESTful endpoints

# 2. METHODOLOGY

## 2.1 Software model used
The project followed an iterative-incremental development approach:
- Iterative cycles for requirements, implementation, and testing to reduce risk and incorporate feedback
- MVC architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability
- RESTful conventions for clean, decoupled client–server interaction

Key activities per iteration:
- Plan: refine requirements and prioritize features
- Build: implement features with unit tests
- Integrate: connect modules and verify data flow
- Validate: run functional and usability tests; collect feedback

# 4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

## 4.1 Functional Requirements
### User Management
- Account creation with email verification; secure login/logout
- Profile update and preferences management
- Password reset and change

### Discussion Management
- Create topics, post replies (including nested replies)
- Categorize and organize threads
- Edit own posts

### Search and Navigation
- Full‑text search across topics and posts
- Filtering by category, date, user
- Pagination for large result sets
- Bookmarking favorite topics

### Administrative Functions
- User management (roles, activation, deactivation)
- Category management (create, edit, reorder)
- Content moderation (approve, edit, delete, warn/ban)
- System settings configuration

Non‑functional requirements (summary):
- Performance: <3s page load; handle ~1000 concurrent users; fast queries
- Security: password hashing; input validation; XSS/CSRF protections; secure sessions
- Usability & Accessibility: intuitive UI; accessible to users with disabilities
- Reliability: 99.5% uptime target; daily backups; graceful error recovery

# 5. IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING

## 5.1 Flow Chart
Key process flows implemented:
- User Registration: form input → validate → check duplicates → create user → send verification → activate account
- Authentication: credentials input → validate → DB check → create session/redirect or show error
- Topic Creation: select category → enter title/description → validate → persist → update stats → redirect
- Reply Posting: open topic → write reply → validate → persist → update counters → render
- Moderation: review reports → decide action (approve/edit/delete/warn) → log and notify

## 5.2 Database snapshot
Main entities and fields:
- Users(user_id, username, email, password_hash, registration_date, last_login, user_role, profile_picture, bio)
- Categories(category_id, name, description, created_by, created_date)
- Topics(topic_id, title, description, created_by, created_date, category_id, view_count, reply_count, is_sticky, is_locked)
- Posts(post_id, topic_id, user_id, content, created_date, updated_date, parent_post_id)

Relationships:
- User 1‑N Topic; Topic N‑1 Category; Topic 1‑N Post; Post 1‑N Post (self‑reply)

## 5.3 Code/project snippets

  login.php
  register.php
  forum.php
  profile.php
```

Example responsibilities:
- Authentication module: login/logout, session handling, email verification checks
- DB connection: PDO with error handling and sensible defaults
- Topic management: create, list (filters, pagination), update (lock/unlock), delete

Testing summary:
- Unit: functions and DB operations
- Integration: module interactions and data flow between components
- System/UAT: end‑to‑end scenarios and usability across devices
- Results (sample): Unit 25 cases (23 pass), Integration 15 (14 pass), System 20 (18 pass)
- Performance: avg response ~1.2s; peak ~500 concurrent users within limits
